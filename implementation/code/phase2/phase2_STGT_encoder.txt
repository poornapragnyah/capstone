PHASE - 2: STGT ENCODER

STEPS:
1) Create the spatial graph which takes the distance between electrodes on the scalp. (from >
2) this graph is saved as a tensor in file - Ahat_adjacency_matrix.pt

3) Create matrix X which is the input features - EEG data
This represents features of nodes(eeg channels) at a given point in time
each row represents one of the 62 eeg channels
cols represent features asssociated w each channel - amplitude

4) implement the GCN layer
