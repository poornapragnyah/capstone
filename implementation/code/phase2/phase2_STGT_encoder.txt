PHASE - 2: STGT ENCODER

STEPS:
1) Create the spatial graph which takes the distance between electrodes on the scalp. (from >
2) this graph is saved as a tensor in file - Ahat_adjacency_matrix.pt

3) Create matrix X which is the input features - EEG data
This represents features of nodes(eeg channels) at a given point in time
each row represents one of the 62 eeg channels
cols represent features asssociated w each channel - amplitude

4) implement the GCN layer 
it's job is to:
1) mix each channel's signal with its neighbours signal (based on spatial matrix A_hat)
2) learn how to reshape this mixed signal into more useful features for the next part of the model

how does it do so?
-> multiply spatial_graph called matrix A_hat with EEG data matrix X
-> transform using W
-> applies ReLU

how will this GCN layer be used?
- The SGTG encoder will receive a batch of EEG data from eeg_tensors.pt
- loop through each of the timesteps in that EEG (400 ts)
- for each t, it'll extarct X for that specific time 
- It passes X and A_hat through to the GCN Layer.
- A new feature matrix will be output from here and sent to the Temporal Transformer.
